| Given a tsv input file containing stock market data, this program identifies:|
| * crazy days (when there are high price fluctuations in a single day)        |
| * craziest days (the day for which the price fluctuation was highest)        |
| * stock splits of 2:1, 3:1, and 3:2 ratios                                   |
